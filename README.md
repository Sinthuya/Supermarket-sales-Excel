- Average Quantity Ordered: On average, each transaction involves a quantity of 5.51 items. 
- Variability in Quantity Ordered:The standard deviation of quantity ordered is about 2.92, suggesting some variability in the quantity of items per transaction.

##### Total Sales:
- Total Sales: The combined total sales for all stores amount to $322,966.75.
- Average Total Sales: The average total sales per transaction are approximately $322.97.
